Machine Learning 2016 Spring, Class project repo for Aaron Gonzales and Steven Hoffman

We have chosen a project with a *deep learning thrust* that will focus primarily on implementing the work done by Hong, et al. in [*Online Tracking by Learning Discriminative Saliency Map with Convolutional Neural Network*](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/hong15.pdf) from [ICML 2015](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/).

Note, this assumes that you have downloaded and compiled [MatConvNet](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/) into a directory named *matconvnet/*, that you have the appropriate data in a directory named *data/*, and that you have a directory named *net/* to contain downloaded CNNs, all under the project's root directory.
