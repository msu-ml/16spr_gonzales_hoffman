Machine Learning 2016 Spring, Class project repo for Aaron Gonzales and Steven Hoffman

We have chosen a project with a *deep learning thrust* that will focus primarily on implementing the work done by Hong, et al. in [*Online Tracking by Learning Discriminative Saliency Map with Convolutional Neural Network*](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/hong15.pdf) from [ICML 2015](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/).
